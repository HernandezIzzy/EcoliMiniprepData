# EcoliMiniprepData
R scripts that I have used to analyze experimental data from an E. coli miniprep development experiment. Includes pulling in the data, assigning variable, and creating data visualizations with the ggplot2 package.  Data comes from a real experiment. There are two sources of data I am using for analysis: -1. DNA concentrations of the E. coli miniprep --> compare concentrations within two populations of E. coli grown in different medias (minimal media vs. rich-growth media) -2. NGS Data: Compare penalty scores for the plasmids grown in minimal media vs. those grown in the rich media. Are the plasmids genetically identical if you compare 1 clone grown in minimal media vs. its respective clone grown in rich media?  Present images of the plots to summarize the data --> this was later presented at an actual development meeting at work.
